# D118-Athletics-Activities-Flags

Script to set the athletics and activities flags based on the related course enrollment  
Our district has sections in PowerSchool for each sport and activity.  
This is extremely specific to our district and not probably very useful to others, as it needs each course name to check for, 
and the order of the autocomm field names specifically defined.
